        <h1>The Science Behind Climate Change</h1>
        
        <h2>1. The Greenhouse Effect</h2>
        <p>The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface and makes life possible. However, human activities have intensified this effect, leading to global warming.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How It Works:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Sun emits energy in the form of sunlight, which passes through the atmosphere and warms the Earth's surface.</li>
                    <li>The Earth then radiates this energy back toward space as infrared radiation (heat).</li>
                    <li>Greenhouse gases (GHGs) like CO₂, CH₄, and H₂O trap some of this heat, preventing it from escaping into space.</li>
                    <li>This trapped heat keeps the planet's temperature stable and habitable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Human Amplification:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have increased greenhouse gas concentrations.</li>
                    <li>This enhanced greenhouse effect is causing global warming.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. The Carbon Cycle</h2>
        <p>The carbon cycle is the natural process by which carbon is exchanged between the atmosphere, oceans, soil, and living organisms. Human activities have disrupted this cycle.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Components:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Atmosphere: Carbon exists as CO₂, regulating Earth's temperature.</li>
                    <li>Oceans: Act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO₂ but causing ocean acidification.</li>
                    <li>Land: Plants and soil absorb CO₂ through photosynthesis.</li>
                    <li>Fossil Fuels: Carbon stored over millions of years is released when burned.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Human Disruption:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Burning fossil fuels increases atmospheric CO₂.</li>
                    <li>Deforestation reduces CO₂ absorption.</li>
                    <li>Atmospheric CO₂ levels have risen dramatically.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Key Scientific Evidence of Climate Change</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Rising Global Temperatures</h3>
        <p>
            - The Earth's average surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C (2°F) since the late 19th century, with the most significant warming occurring in the past few decades.<br>
            - The last decade (2011–2020) was the warmest on record, and 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Melting Ice and Snow</h3>
        <p>
            - Glaciers and ice sheets worldwide are shrinking at an accelerating rate. For example, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing billions of tons of ice annually.<br>
            - Arctic sea ice is declining in both extent and thickness, with summer sea ice reaching record lows.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Rising Sea Levels</h3>
        <p>
            - Global sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters (8 inches) since 1900, with the rate of rise accelerating due to melting ice and thermal expansion of seawater as it warms.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Ocean Warming and Acidification</h3>
        <p>
            - The oceans have absorbed about 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases, leading to higher sea temperatures.<br>
            - Increased CO₂ absorption has caused ocean acidification, threatening marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons.
        </p>

        <h3>3.5 Extreme Weather Events</h3>
        <p>
            - The frequency and intensity of heatwaves, hurricanes, droughts, and heavy rainfall events have increased, consistent with climate change predictions.
        </p>

        <h3>3.6 Atmospheric CO₂ Levels</h3>
        <p>
            - Direct measurements from ice cores show that CO₂ levels have risen dramatically since the Industrial Revolution, far exceeding natural fluctuations over the past 800,000 years.
        </p>

        <h3>3.7 Ecological Changes</h3>
        <p>
            - Species are shifting their ranges toward the poles or to higher altitudes in response to warming temperatures.<br>
            - Phenological changes, such as earlier flowering of plants and earlier migration of birds, are being observed.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The science behind climate change is robust and well-documented. The greenhouse effect, amplified by human activities, is driving global warming. Disruptions to the carbon cycle are increasing atmospheric CO₂ levels, while key evidence—such as rising temperatures, melting ice, and extreme weather—confirms the reality of climate change. Addressing this crisis requires a deep understanding of these scientific principles and a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable practices, renewable energy, and global cooperation. The evidence is clear: the time to act is now.</p>

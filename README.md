ClimateConnect: An Interactive AI-Powered Platform for Climate Awareness, Industry Accountability, and Action
Problem Statement:
Climate change remains one of the most pressing global challenges, yet public awareness and engagement in mitigation efforts are limited. Existing platforms provide fragmented information, lack real-time climate data, and fail to encourage interactive discussions. Additionally, industries—one of the largest contributors to carbon emissions—often lack transparency in their environmental impact, making it difficult for individuals and organizations to hold them accountable. As a result, both individuals and industries remain uninformed about the severity of climate change and the practical actions they can take to combat it.

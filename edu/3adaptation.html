            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Climate change is reshaping the way we design and manage our infrastructure. With rising sea levels, intensified rainfall, and unprecedented urban growth, the need for resilient infrastructure is critical. This document provides an in-depth analysis of three key components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flood Defenses:</strong> Measures to prevent or mitigate flood damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainable Cities:</strong> Urban environments designed to reduce environmental footprints and enhance quality of life.</li>
                <li><strong>Eco-Friendly Architecture:</strong> Building practices that conserve energy, minimize resource use, and integrate with natural ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, these components represent a multi-layered approach to safeguarding communities and economies against climate impacts.</p>

            <h2>2. Flood Defenses</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Definition and Scope</h3>
            <p>Flood defenses encompass a variety of engineered solutions and nature-based strategies designed to protect communities from the impacts of flooding. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structural Barriers:</strong> Levees, dams, and floodwalls constructed to divert or contain water.</li>
                <li><strong>Nature-Based Solutions:</strong> Wetlands restoration and green infrastructure that naturally absorb and slow floodwaters.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrated Systems:</strong> Stormwater management networks that combine hard infrastructure with green solutions for sustainable water management.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.2 Drivers and Causes of Need</h3>
            <p>The rising demand for effective flood defenses is driven by several factors:</p>
            <ul>

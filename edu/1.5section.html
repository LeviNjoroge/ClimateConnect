            <p>Climate change is not just an environmental issue; it also poses significant threats to human societies, affecting food security, health, economies, and migration patterns.</p>
            
            <h3>Food Security</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Yields:</strong> Rising temperatures, droughts, and unpredictable weather are reducing agricultural productivity, particularly in vulnerable regions like sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.</li>
                <li><strong>Fisheries:</strong> Ocean warming and acidification are disrupting marine ecosystems, threatening fish populations that millions rely on for food and income.</li>
                <li><strong>Food Prices:</strong> Reduced crop yields and disrupted supply chains are driving up food prices, exacerbating hunger and malnutrition.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Health Risks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heat-Related Illnesses:</strong> Increased heatwaves are causing heatstroke, dehydration, and cardiovascular diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Higher temperatures worsen air quality, increasing respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Spread:</strong> Warmer climates are expanding the range of disease-carrying insects like mosquitoes, leading to the spread of malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Climate-related disasters, such as floods and wildfires, are causing trauma, anxiety, and displacement, impacting mental health.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Economic Impacts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Damage:</strong> Extreme weather events are destroying homes, roads, and utilities, requiring costly repairs and reconstruction.</li>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Losses:</strong> Farmers face reduced yields and income due to droughts, floods, and pests.</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance Costs:</strong> The increasing frequency of natural disasters is driving up insurance premiums and financial risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Tourism:</strong> Climate change is affecting natural attractions like coral reefs, snow-capped mountains, and wildlife, impacting tourism-dependent economies.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Displacement and Migration</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate Refugees:</strong> Rising sea levels, droughts, and extreme weather are forcing people to leave their homes, creating climate refugees.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Conflicts:</strong> Competition for dwindling resources like water and arable land can lead to social unrest and displacement.</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Pressure:</strong> Migration to cities is increasing pressure on urban infrastructure, housing, and services.</li>
            </ul>

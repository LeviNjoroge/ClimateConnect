            <p>Climate change is having profound and far-reaching effects on the environment, disrupting ecosystems and natural processes that sustain life on Earth. Here are some of the most significant environmental impacts:</p>
            
            <h3>Rising Temperatures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Warming:</strong> The Earth's average surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C (2°F) since the late 19th century, with the most rapid warming occurring in recent decades.</li>
                <li><strong>Heatwaves:</strong> More frequent and intense heatwaves are occurring worldwide, stressing ecosystems, wildlife, and human health.</li>
                <li><strong>Ocean Warming:</strong> Oceans absorb over 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases, leading to higher sea temperatures and disrupting marine ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Extreme Weather Events</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intensified Storms:</strong> Hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons are becoming more powerful due to warmer ocean waters, leading to greater destruction.</li>
                <li><strong>Droughts and Floods:</strong> Changes in precipitation patterns are causing prolonged droughts in some regions and severe flooding in others.</li>
                <li><strong>Wildfires:</strong> Hotter, drier conditions are increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires, destroying forests, homes, and wildlife habitats.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Melting Glaciers and Ice Sheets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Polar Ice Loss:</strong> The Arctic is warming at twice the global average rate, leading to rapid melting of sea ice and glaciers.</li>
                <li><strong>Rising Sea Levels:</strong> Melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, along with thermal expansion of seawater, are causing sea levels to rise, threatening coastal communities and ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Freshwater Sources:</strong> Glaciers are critical sources of freshwater for millions of people. Their melting jeopardizes water supplies for drinking, agriculture, and hydropower.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Biodiversity Loss</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habitat Destruction:</strong> Rising temperatures, deforestation, and extreme weather are destroying habitats, pushing many species toward extinction.</li>
                <li><strong>Shifting Ecosystems:</strong> Species are migrating to cooler areas, disrupting ecosystems and food chains.</li>
                <li><strong>Coral Bleaching:</strong> Warmer oceans are causing coral reefs to bleach and die, affecting marine biodiversity and the livelihoods of people who depend on them.</li>
            </ul>

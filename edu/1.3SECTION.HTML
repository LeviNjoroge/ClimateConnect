            <p>Climate change is driven by a combination of human activities that release greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere, trapping heat and altering the Earth's climate system. The major contributors to climate change include industrial emissions, deforestation, agriculture, and the burning of fossil fuels. Understanding these contributors is essential for identifying solutions and mitigating their impacts.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Industrial Emissions</h3>
            <p>Industrial activities are a significant source of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O).</p>
            <h4>Key Sources:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> The production of cement, steel, chemicals, and other materials releases large amounts of CO₂.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Use:</strong> Factories and industrial facilities often rely on fossil fuels for power, contributing to emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Landfills and waste treatment processes emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Impact:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Industrial processes account for about 20-25% of global CO₂ emissions.</li>
                <li>The release of non-CO₂ gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, further exacerbates the greenhouse effect.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. Deforestation</h3>
            <p>Deforestation refers to the large-scale removal of forests, primarily for agriculture, logging, and urban expansion. Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO₂ from the atmosphere, so their destruction has a double impact on climate change.</p>
            <h4>Key Drivers:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Expansion:</strong> Forests are cleared to create farmland for crops and livestock.</li>
                <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Timber extraction for construction, paper, and other products contributes to forest loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> The growth of cities and infrastructure leads to the clearing of forested areas.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Impact:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Deforestation is responsible for about 10-15% of global greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                <li>The loss of forests reduces the planet's ability to absorb CO₂, exacerbating the greenhouse effect.</li>
                <li>It also leads to biodiversity loss and disrupts ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Agriculture</h3>
            <p>Agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, primarily through the release of methane and nitrous oxide, which are far more potent than CO₂ in terms of their warming potential.</p>
            <h4>Key Sources:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Livestock Farming:</strong> Cows, sheep, and other ruminants produce methane during digestion (enteric fermentation). Manure management also releases methane and nitrous oxide.</li>
                <li><strong>Rice Paddies:</strong> Flooded rice fields create anaerobic conditions that produce methane.</li>
                <li><strong>Synthetic Fertilizers:</strong> The use of nitrogen-based fertilizers releases nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas.</li>
                <li><strong>Land Use Changes:</strong> Converting forests and grasslands into agricultural land releases stored carbon.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Impact:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Agriculture accounts for about 24% of global greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                <li>Methane and nitrous oxide have global warming potentials 28 and 265 times greater than CO₂, respectively, over a 100-year period.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Fossil Fuels</h3>
            <p>The burning of fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions, primarily in the form of CO₂.</p>
            <h4>Key Sources:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Energy Production:</strong> Coal and natural gas are burned to generate electricity, accounting for a significant portion of global emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Cars, trucks, airplanes, and ships rely on gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, all derived from fossil fuels.</li>
                <li><strong>Heating and Cooling:</strong> Homes and businesses use fossil fuels for heating and air conditioning.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Impact:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fossil fuel combustion is responsible for about 75% of global CO₂ emissions and 90% of total greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                <li>The energy sector alone contributes about 40% of global CO₂ emissions.</li>
                <li>Fossil fuels also release air pollutants that harm human health and the environment.</li>
            </ul>
